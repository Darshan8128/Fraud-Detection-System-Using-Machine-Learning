# üõ°Ô∏è Fraud Detection Project

## üìå Overview
This project focuses on building a **Fraud Detection System** using machine learning techniques.  
Financial fraud is a critical issue that costs businesses billions annually. The goal of this project is to design, train, and evaluate models that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

The project is implemented in **Python** within a Jupyter Notebook (`analysis_model.ipynb`) and leverages popular data science libraries.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **Description**: Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.  
  - 284,807 transactions
  - 492 frauds (0.172% of all transactions, highly imbalanced dataset)
  - Features: 30 anonymized columns (`V1, V2, ‚Ä¶, V28`), `Amount`, and `Time`
  - Target variable: `Class` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to sensitivity, dataset is **not included**. Please download separately and place it in the `data/` folder.

## üß† Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize transaction `Amount` and `Time`
   - Handle class imbalance (SMOTE / undersampling / oversampling)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Fraud vs non-fraud distribution
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Feature importance
3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost / LightGBM
   - Neural Networks (optional)
4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy (not reliable due to imbalance)
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - AUC-ROC Curve
   - Confusion Matrix
